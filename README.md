# TrustZone_Pincode
This is a small application of TrustZone in STM32L5, in which we authentificate using a pin code stored in the secured area, you will find along side with this project a technical report <in french> in which we describe how the configuration and the procedure was done to achieve this.

Think of changing the COM port in the GUI "executable_interface_pycharm" in order to ensure sending the data to the right port.
